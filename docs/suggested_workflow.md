# Introduction and motivation

This file outlines a suggested workflow for working with Jupyter
notebooks.  Jupyter notebooks are *awesome* because:
1. they can store text, images, code, error messages and more all in one file,
2. with all of the main thoughts and results stored in the same file, that single file can be shared between people who are working remotely, and
3. all you need to see and interact with this file is a web browser.

## A **workflow** is the series of steps that go from
1. getting the starting materials (e.g. assignment instructions),
2. putting those materials in a working environment (e.g. a computer),
3. doing the work,
4. (optionally) sharing the work in intermediate or final form (e.g. collaboration), and
5. pushing the finished product to a final destination (e.g. handing in an assignment).

## A typical workflow could look like:
1. downloading a template from Blackboard,
2. opening the template on your computer/tablet,
3. putting your own work into the template,
4. (optionally) emailing a copy to a friend for feedback,
5. uploading the final result to Blackboard.

## The possible roadblocks with the above workflow for climate science and oceanography are:
+ you will need to install specialized software (and maybe it's not even available for your platform, e.g. there's no app available for it for your tablet)
+ you will need large, additional data sets that will take up precious bandwidth and space on your local device, and
+ sharing of intermediate results for collaboration is clunky (e.g. which e-mail with which attachment is the right one? Did you share all the necessary files? Did any files get garbled because your collaborator doesn't have exactly the right version/setup of the software on their computer?).

## To address the issues above, I propose the following workflow:
1. creating a copy of the template on GitHub (from link in Blackboard/e-mail),
2. pulling your copy of the template to cloud computing resources (all the software is preinstalled and all the data is already there),
3. putting your own work into the template,
4. (optionally) pushing changes (at any stage in the work) to GitHub for sharing,
5. uploading the final result to Blackboard.

While perhaps dauting at first, using GitHub will make collaboration much
much much easier.  You can quickly push multiple versions of your notebook
(including any error messages) to a space where you control exactly who
sees your data.  All versions are tracked so you can be confident that you
know exactly which one is the current version and if you break something,
you can display just the differences between versions to compare them
and/or revert to a previous version.

And if you need even more motivation for diving into this workflow, the
tools and concepts we use here lie at the core of the Internet as we
know it today.  International teams of scientists and commerical developers
use GitHub as one of the *defacto* standards for collaboration.  The vast
majority of artifical intelligence teaching and research is shared via
Jupyter notebooks.  Cloud computing is likely to be the main, and
most environmentally responsible, way to interact with large commerical
or scientific data sets.  This is the way things were before
COVID-19 and it will continue to be this way even after our massive
experiment in remote learning is over.

# Step 1: Logging in

1. Ensure you are logged onto the VPN.  You may need 2-factor authentification with `Push` as your second password.

2. Then go to the [JupyterHub portal](https://jupyter.bowdoin.edu), enter your username and password, and select the default notebook.  Access to bigger resources is available, but it is very unlikely you will need them in this class.

3. After logging in, you will have a view of your home directory on your cloud resource.  Either select a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) file that already exists or create a new file.  When creating a new file, use the `Python 3.6` option.

4. A new tab opens with your Jupyter notebook.  The notebook is structured as a series of cells which can be viewed as a way to organize your thoughts into coherent logical steps.  Cells can be code that tells the computer to do stuff or they can display your notes, images, and other relevant content.  The beauty of notebooks is that *nearly everything is in one file*.

5. After you are done working, for submitting your assignments, save your work by clicking on the floppy disk icon in the toolbar and download the Jupyter notebook as a `.pdf` and upload the `.pdf` to the specific assignment in Blackboard.  This allows for you to keep a record of your submissions and I can provide feedback by annotating and grading your submissions directly in Blackboard.

6. You can always go back to the original landing tab to select other files to view/edit within your cloud computing instance.

7. The original landing tab can also be used to open a terminal where you can issue commands directly to the underlying operating system of your cloud computing instance.  As we shall see later, the terminal is how we will pull and push our work from GitHub.
